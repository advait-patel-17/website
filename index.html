    <p class="invisible-box">this site is a work in progress. please don't mind the mess.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="invisible-box">i'm currently a junior at the university of illinois (uiuc) studying computer science. my interests include robotics, deep learning, math, and software engineering. my goal for the next decade is to make robots ubiquitous in our everyday lives. i'm specifically interested in home robots and robots for manufacturing.</p>
    <p class="invisible-box" style="margin-bottom: 5px;"></p>
    <p class="invisible-box">last summer, i was doing full-stack development for capital one. the summer before that, i was finetuning large language models for a startup.</p>
    <p class="invisible-box" style="margin-bottom: 5px;"></p>
    <p class="invisible-box">at uiuc, i'm currently a founder and co-chair for <a href="https://sigrobotics.acm.illinois.edu">SIGRobotics</a>, a special interest group under <a href="https://acm.illinois.edu">ACM@UIUC</a> dedicated to encouraging project-based exploration in robotics. i was also previously part of the Gies Disruption Lab, where I led a team of 6 students to develop an AI tutor by finetuning large language models on coursework.</p>
    <p class="invisible-box" style="margin-bottom: 5px;"></p>
    <p class="invisible-box">i'm currently looking for internships in robotics, deep learning, and/or software engineering for spring and summer 2025. feel free to contact me via email (advaitpatel04 at gmail dot com) or any of the links below.</p>
